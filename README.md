# ( using supervised machine-learning algorithms to guess the covid-19 test result by analyzing
# symptoms )


# Introduction :					

With the worst coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak currently occurring, taking steps to avoid getting and spreading the virus has become a necessary part of our everyday routine. However, some people are still failing to take the issue seriously enough. Whether it's due to denial, living in a bubble of falsehoods, no proper info about the damage the virus can cause, Major crunch of the people failing in the prevention of virus spread.					
Fever, common-cold, cough, losing smell and taste, diarrhea are some of the commonly seen symptoms in the patients of COVID-19. The virus damaged the health system of senior citizens with existing health issues. Moreover, many covid-19 positive patients have experienced breathing difficulty, which in most of the cases seemed to be a symptom of flu.
In this project, we are planning to build a model using supervised machine learning techniques/algorithms to predict the COVID-19 virus. Our goal is to predict the outcome of the covid-19 lab result based on the symptoms. We intend to use the lab results of the covid antigen test as our targeted variables using symptoms features.

# Project Activities Completed Since Last Check-in :
-> Since the idea proposal day, we have met multiple times through zoom and in-person on class days and discussed the project stuff whenever needed.
-> After initial discussion, I have read about the symptoms of COVID-19 in depth. To get to know about the important symptoms causing COVID-19 and the importance of each symptom in making the virus deathful
-> After getting knowledge about symptoms, I have started collecting data from mexican and various health websites for the columns allotted to me.  

-> The following set of columns are allotted to me for data collection from mexican  health 
     website. 
      - Smoking : ( Numeric value indicating the seriousness )
      - Other Cause: ( Numeric value indicating the seriousness )
      - Result: ( Numeric value indicating the seriousness )
      - Migrant:  ( Numeric value indicating the seriousness )
      - Country Nationality: ( String  value indicating the country )
      - Country Origin : ( String indicating the origin of country )
      - ICU :  ( String  value indicating the country )
-> I have implemented formatting on the following above set of columns.
-> Since our project is based on the supervised learning algorithms, I have started learning the following machine learning algorithms : 
     - Nearest Neighbor
     - Naive Bayes

# Project Activities in Progress :  
-> I’m learning the following  supervised algorithms now 
     - SVM ( Support Vector Machine )
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Linear Regression
     - Neural Networks
-> I’m gaining knowledge about training and test data to get efficient accuracy.
-> And I’m learning the implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest. 

# Project Activities Planned :
-> Implementation of Train and Test data
-> Implementation of visualization to provide in-sights
