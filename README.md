## ( using supervised machine-learning algorithms to guess the covid-19 test result by analyzing
## symptoms )


Introduction :					

With the worst coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak currently occurring, taking steps to avoid getting and spreading the virus has become a necessary part of our everyday routine. However, some people are still failing to take the issue seriously enough. Whether it's due to denial, living in a bubble of falsehoods, no proper info about the damage the virus can cause, Major crunch of the people failing in the prevention of virus spread.					
Fever, common-cold, cough, losing smell and taste, diarrhea are some of the commonly seen symptoms in the patients of COVID-19. The virus damaged the health system of senior citizens with existing health issues. Moreover, many covid-19 positive patients have experienced breathing difficulty, which in most of the cases seemed to be a symptom of flu.
In this project, we are planning to build a model using supervised machine learning techniques/algorithms to predict the COVID-19 virus. Our goal is to predict the outcome of the covid-19 lab result based on the symptoms. We intend to use the lab results of the covid antigen test as our targeted variables using symptoms features.

Project Activities Completed Since Last Check-in :
-> Since the project check-in one, we’ve met multiple times through zoom and in-person on class days and discussed supervised machine learning algorithms and solved the issues we faced while implementing.
-> We found the relevancy between columns by using the correlation analysis.
-> I’ve learnt and implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms on the data set. 

Project Activities in Progress :  
-> I’m learning the accuracy calculation and accuracy improvement of algorithms.
-> I’m currently learning the visualization methods and techniques. As, we have planned to    visualize and provide some in-sights in  our project

Project Activities Planned :
-> visualization to provide in-sights for better understanding of the data and results.
-> Calculating and Improving the accuracy and making necessary changes.
-> Testing the algorithms with different data and checking the result.
